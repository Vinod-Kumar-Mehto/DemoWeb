            We live in an age of constant numbers, charts and statistics. Big
            data seems to be everywhere. Qualitative research is one of the few
            disciplines that remains pure. Qualitative research attempts to
            understand–through person-to-person interviews how and why people
            think and behave the way they do. Admittedly, qualitative research
            has adapted to the digital age,And we now have the option to conduct
            online panels and get mobile feedback, but even with digital
            methods, the essence remains the same: take a small sample size,
            spend time with individuals, and gauge their impressions and
            inspirations.

            Qualitative research overall is less easy to define than
            quantitative research, which measures the proportion of a population
            that thinks or behaves in a certain way. In qualitative market
            research, we explore the what, why and how rather than how many. We
            strive to understand meaning rather than simply measure. The
            insights we gain from qualitative methods can and do change the way
            a business operates; Our findings impact not only branding and
            messaging, but also product development, positioning, pricing, and
            customer service. Investing in qualitative marketing research is an
            investment that pays off many times over,And it's the most effective
            way for companies to get an objective view of how and why their
            customers think and behave the way they do.

            Qualitative research has its roots in the social sciences–
            disciplines such as anthropology, psychology and sociology have
            refined methodologies and created frameworks that have translated to
            the fast-paced business world. At HorizonScope, we were trained in
            the academic methodology of qualitative research, so each study
            design,The survey structure, and qualitative coding process goes
            through our rigorous methodology, but rather than spending a year or
            years studying a topic, as the academic world does, we fit
            companies' answers into compressed timelines designed to To happen,
            they modify their strategy so that they can act immediately. Above.

            The most common qualitative methods we employ include focus groups,
            in-depth interviews and ethnographic research. We often design
            studies using a mix of these styles, and we almost always combine
            our qualitative research with quantitative data to help understand
            our findings in a larger statistical context.
